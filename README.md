# LoL Voice Chat

LoL Voice Chat is a web app allowing users to join a voice call with the players of their team in League of Legends.

The user can simply enter their Game Name along with their Tag Name, and they will be instantly connected to a room corresponding to their game ID

## Note

We still have not implemented users logging in with their actual Riot accounts, as we don't expect players to trust our web app yet. As such, we cannot prove a player's identity, and some players might log in as other players.

This project being a prototype, you might stumble on exploits or bugs. It would be very appreciated if you let us know about them by opening an issue or sending us an email:
